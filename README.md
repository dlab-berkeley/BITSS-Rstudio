BITSS-Rstudio
=============

The official home for this is https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BITSS-Rstudio

This repository was put together using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). 
Open the Rproj file, and you should be able to follow along with the slides in the Rpres file!

If you want to install the packages necessary to run the R code, you should run the install-packages.R
script from within R. (The easiest way to do this would be to run `source('install-packages.R')` from the
R prompt in RStudio.)
